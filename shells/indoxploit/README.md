#idXploit

The code seems to be from Indonesian hacker or effectively modified from other sources. 
It looks like other similar shells with stuff renamed to looked indonesian.
It has more features like MySQL database support.

### Where it is found
Usually in your uploads folder renamed to something like jpg/gif or other files in hopes of causing a php execution
through `Direct File Access`

It would work quite easily as most sites are not well protected against such basic attacks.
Badly configured Nginx could be prone as well if you pass all files to `fastcgi`.

### how to find (easy)
- look for the file text with `grep rl "keyword" <directory>`
- make sure you include non php extensions.
- since the exploit does not encrypt or bother to use `eval` etc to hide the code it is quite easy to locate it


### prevention
- ensure only `.php` files are executed by apache or nginx
- disable any execution in files uploaded to your uploads folder.
- ensure correct permissions. Uploads folder does not require write permission except for webserver user.
