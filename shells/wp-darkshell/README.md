#Dark Shell
Injected via Wordpress hacks to create a shell backdoor to your site/server. Allows uploading of arbitrary files or slingshot attacks.
Typically used to edit `.htaccess` files and create SEO related hijacks. provides very basic interface which can be used to inject better shells.

### Symptoms
- Your site has weird Google results you do not recognize
- You get notification from `Google Search Console` that your site has new ownerhsip or changes made that you are unaware.

### Detection
- file and directory names can differ, don't rely on them. Modification times, however, will be the same for all components.
- check the modification time on index.php and .htaccess to detect tampering
- look for a directory of bogus sitemap files which will contain spam urls.
- look for keywords like `port_scan`.(e.g. `grep -rl "port_scan" <directory>) to find mide.php

### Notes
- exploit is only partly successful on nginx due to the modification of .htaccess 
- contents of wp-config.php, including database password, should be considered compromised.
